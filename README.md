This is the repository storing my all Data Structure and Algorithms.
All the problems solved on leetcode are stored in this repository.
Every problem is being solved following the approach of brute force then moving to better solution.
last commit will contain the Optimal solution of the problem.
All the problems are solved using Java.
To understand the proper approach of any problemn, you should read starting from the first commit of the problem.

Thanks
